## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**
Tech used: HTML, CSS, React

This is my very first time utilizing foundational React concepts such as state to build an interactive web app.

## Optimizations

- I would further optimize the app for mobile use. 

- Adding a link to download a png of your meme would be great for users. Currently, there is no option to download.

- Adding a scroller that can dictate where you want to place text depending on the image

## Lessons Learned:

Through this project, I learned a lot about foundational React concepts, such as:

- Event listeners

- State

- Conditional Rendering

- Forms

- Side Effects
